# Amazing Divide Stuff Framework
**This is just a silly repo to experiment with deploying a package to PyPI and setting up good CI/CD practices**


It will quite literally divide stuff for you.

## How to use
```
from divide_stuff import Divider

divider = Divider()
divider.divide_numbers_print(20, 10)

result = divider.divide_numbers(20, 10)

# Amazing!!
```
